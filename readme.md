# README

Here you will find the code for the BETA test generation tool. More information about the tool can be found on the website [www.beta-tool.info](http://www.beta-tool.info/).

## Setting up development environment

- We use Gradle to build the project. So you should download it from their [website](http://www.gradle.org/) and install it before you proceed.
- Clone the repository main folder (the folder which contains all the subprojects).
- Using the terminal switch to the main project folder and run:
- 		gradle build
- This command will download all dependencies, build and test the projects. Then run:
- 		gradle eclipse
- This will build the eclipse files so you can import the projects on eclipse.
- Open eclipse then go to File->Import->General->Existing Projects into Workspace, click on Next. 
- On 'Select root directory' browse for the project main folder.
- On the 'Options' section make sure the checkbox 'Search for nested projects' is checked. This will show all the subprojects of the main folder.
- Finally, select all the subprojects (don't select the main project folder) and click on 'Finish'
